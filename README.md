    1. Implementing the classes and FileStorage and the Command Interpreter

The Command Interpreter:
    The command interpreter (the console) is a shell for creating, updating and destroying our class instances, attributes and objects

    To start the console:
        $ ./console.py

    To use the console:
        Type in any console command of your choice: e.g

            $create User
            $quit
